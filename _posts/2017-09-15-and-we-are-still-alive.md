I've meant to do this since the beginning of the Year, but being the eclectic guy I was involved in some AI projects and SalesForce work. For the records, I'm not good at AI yet, and SalesForce "cool factor" is gone (sorry fans of SalesForce), so I didn't feel like blogging about it.

There is also the blog itself. The previous version was made with a local version of Ghost, but it wasn't easy to maintain it online (since it was building the HTML offline first). I also learned a few things about SEO and standard Schemas, so I wanted to give it a try.

So I ended up using old good Jekyll.

Thanks to Github, I've become used to markdown, to the point that these days I appreciate its simplicity (vs. having a WYSIWYG interface like in the last Year). And since this website is hosted in Github, I can create blog posts directly from it (if needed). This little thing becomes very important while traveling, since now I can edit my blog and have it properly versioned even from a smartphone (while still maintaining the static nature of the CMS that I wanted). It is also more portable than in the past.

It's not like this blog is super popular, but it's nice to have a place where I can collect my thoughts.

Let's see how far I get this Year. Wish me luck :)
