It's been a while. I've been busy. I had a personal emergency back home and had to fly back to South America, where my parents live. Luckily, the company I work with are the awesomest and have supported me on this so... I've basically became one of those "digital nomads".

Except that I'm not nomad at all.

In the last month since I moved back, the farthest I've been (excluding the airport) have been the mall nearby (about a mile away from where I live), and only because I had to fix the internet at home. The house I grew in is a mess, and everything needs to be fixed. It's a hoarders paradise. There was no internet, half-working cable and lack of a proper kitchen. There are three dogs, none of them trained: One is old and pukes everywhere. The other is crazy and poos and pees everywhere. The youngest one barks at everything all the time. And sheds a lot.

The house was also very dirty for starters, and someone had the brilliant idea to wax the floors without cleaning them, so now there are dirt layers within wax ones (I counted 5+ layers so far). Termites and moths have invaded the house, to the point that it seems that every piece of furniture and the hardwood floors may need to be replaced.

Oh, and that is on top of the personal emergency that made me come back home.

Don't get me wrong: I'm not complaining (much). It has to be done. But it will take longer than planned.

I've been somehow able to continue doing work without neglecting my family or the house too much. I'd rant about my plans and how I am dividing my time around that some other time. For now it's time to get back to work.

I've been busy.

Happy New Year to us all.
