Back in January, I told you about the need to go to Peru and what were going to be my future plans.

There was a complication: The company where I work for got acquired by a bigger one (one of those companes that are also in the top 10 of best companies to work for). It is a golden opportunity,but there is a huge "but": they won't let me work from abroad anymore.

So I've been stressed out. My personality is that whenever there is a problem, there should be a solution. This one is more of a choice between having money or having time. The situation at home is luckily more stable, and I have some alternatives in case the current help is not enough. I also brought some tools to fix things around the house, and I have done what I could. The dogs are also better (combo of better diet and spending more time with them --except the crazy one. That bitch is scary). There have been some failed projects tho, but overall it's been ok I think. Change is good.

I still want to do a lot more, but my current job is anything but "cutting edge", so my skills have not been where I wanted. I need to get better at programming my raspberry pis and arduinos (security cameras, air quality/temp sensors, a voice assistant that speaks Spanish, etc.), plus the autotrader v2.0 (wonder how much advanced the DNN tools are nowadays), a better image recognition camera, build furniture, etc. plus update my front end and API design dev chops (maybe some Vue.js this time)

So, I've to come up with a plan. And stick to it.

I need to focus on maximizing my productive time. And then be disciplined. But is so easy to procrastinate...I'll try to at least procrastinate in things where I learn stuff XD
