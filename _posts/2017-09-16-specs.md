I've been denying this blog for a Year already. Things got busier and I am no longer enjoying a "long vacation". Because of my current job, a few things have changed. Mostly:

* No more Erlang/Elixir (my current job is Java-like, so I can only focus on NodeJS as a side project for now) :(
* More DevOps and automation though :), thought it will probably be focused on SalesForce :(
* Vue.js :)
* More IoT stuff :)
* REST services :( (though I will try to blog about GraphQL too. We'll see)

As for the environment itself, this is what I'm currently sporting:

1. Ubuntu Mate
1. Miniconda with Python 3.6
1. Cudas
1. Jupyter, Pytorch and Tensorflow through Conda
1. Docker
1. Jenkins, Maven, Gradle, Ant through Docker
1. NodeJS
1. Vue.js

Everything I do in 2017 (that is not paid by my job) will go to the cloud:

* Blog and Website to github
* Projects in github and codepen
* Recorded demos and videos in youtube
* Other videos and pictures in Onedrive, Dropbox and Box

Of course, many things may have to be reviewed and changed as I learn more and more about them. Stay tuned!
