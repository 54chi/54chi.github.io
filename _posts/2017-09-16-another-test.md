You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

http://localhost:3000/specs/index.html

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

## Basic Setup

3. Clone the repo you just forked.
4. Edit `_config.yml` to personalize your site.
5. Check out the sample posts in `_posts` to see examples for assigning categories and tags, and other YAML data.
6. Read the documentation below for further customization pointers and documentation.

## Site and User Settings

You have to fill some informations on `_config.yml` to customize your site.

{% highlight ruby %}
# Site settings
description: A blog about lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog/
url: "http://localhost:3000" # the base hostname & protocol for your site

# User settings
username: Lorem Ipsum
user_description: Anon Developer at Lorem Ipsum Dolor
user_title: Anon Developer
email: anon@anon.com
twitter_username: lorem_ipsum
github_username:  lorem_ipsum
gplus_username:  lorem_ipsum
disqus_username: lorem_ipsum
{% endhighlight %}

## Color customization

All color variables are in `src/styl/variable`. To change the main color, just set the new value at `main` assignment. Another colors are for texts and the code background color.

## Creating posts

You can use the `initpost.sh` to create your new posts. Just follow the command:

{% highlight bash %}
./initpost.sh -c Post Title
{% endhighlight %}

The new file will be created at `_posts` with this format `date-title.md`.

## Front-matter

When you create a new post, you need to fill the post information in the front-matter, follow this example:

{% highlight ruby %}
