            <p>Here are the places I've checked so far (mostly coffee shops):</p>

<ul>
<li>Starbucks: in my defense, I'd say that I went there to EAT. And they have stuff that you have not seen in other countries, like Lucuma and Chirimoya Frapuccinos. It is one of the most "laptop friendly" places coffee shops too.</li>
<li>Organika: besides selling "organic" coffee (whatever that means), they have a few areas with large tables and blackboards (chalks are cheaper and more eco-friendly than markers) for students or business people to meet up. I got a cortado.</li>
<li>Peru Pa Ti: if you have ever been in a Vapiano's, you will find the similarities. Get a "smart" card at the entrance and use it every time you order at the different stations, in this case: coffee, bakery, drinks, food. Pay at the end. Peruvian food at moderate prices. I got an americano coffee, local craft beers (didn't like them much though) and carapulcra with pork (which was great)</li>
<li>Omatsu: Ramen in Lima? Yep. I got an awesome promo that included classic gyoza (they also sell a vegetarian gyoza filled with quinoa :p), miso ramen, chicken katsu and barley tea for less than $6. The taste was great. And is hard to beat that price!</li>
<li>Naruto: another ramen place near Omatsu, with more hype too! They say they import every ingredient from Japan (and charge you accordingly). I got a Shoyu ramen and a local beer for $9. Besides ramen, they also sell Udon, and not much "fusion" food, which is great if you miss Japan.  </li>
<li>El Jardin de Cieneguilla: a combination of cafe and plant nursery, this outdoor little place in the mountains of Lima is great for brunches and relaxing time with its nice decoration that takes you back to colonial Lima. I had a lemonade with mint (with no sugar), a pork sandwich, a huge apple crispy with cinnamon icecream on top...and a cortado. I don't think I had dinner that day hehe.  </li>
<li>Sofa Cafe: I got there on my way to Bodega Verde. I didn't go to Bodega Verde, instead got all my coffees, plus food and desert here: 3 cortados, tallarines verdes and a classic creme brulee. Very nice place to have a long conversation with friends.</li>
<li>La Gran Fruta: ok, this is not a coffee shop, but a juice bar. Good place for a change of heart after all those coffee cups. I got a 16oz lucuma, banana and strawberry juice for less than $4.</li>
<li>NOS: Nos is a relatively newer restaurant opened by Central's chef (Central is one of the best restaurants in the world). On Tuesdays they had a 2x1 promotion on their burgers, which are awesome, but I tried an "Amazonian salad" instead. Delicious.</li>
<li>Tanta: Tanta is everywhere these days. Similar to NOS, Tanta is by the owner of Central's "competitor": Astrid &amp; Gaston. It's brighter (and noisier) than NOS, but it also had better service ;). I drank a "piscopolitan" and ate a "barranco" salad (you can never go wrong with quinoa and avocado ;))</li>
<li>Las Vecinas: hiding in a small and quiet street of Barranco, this little coffee shop is so cozy that no wonder it is popular despite its odd location. I got an espresso and a lemograss lemonade.</li>
<li>Amoramar: is the place where you go for seafood and/or drinks infused with rocoto and/or a very nice old style colonial house transformed into a very nice new Peruvian food restaurant. I got camu-camu chilcano and a pasta negra (imagine black paella but with pasta instead). A bit salty, but good flavor. I ate so much that I wasn't hungry for the next 24 hrs :p</li>
