In 2016, Sachi decided to take a leap year (aka: quit his job). Tired with the status quo of the IT consulting world (some examples here), he wanted to rethink the way enterprise IT should operate in the modern world, while at the same time doing some upgrading to his skills and travel around the World to prevent this.

At least that was the theory. Sachi is addicted to coffee shops, and decent internet speed...and while he planned a small budget to do this crazy plan, a last minute decision made him postpone his round the World trip (which doesn't seem like a bad decision based on the recent news). So instead, he took a job at a product company...where he ended up doing consulting again (they don't call it consulting, but is very similar anyways). However, unlike to the Big-4 type of consulting, there is less overhead, less meetings, less BS and much more freedom, and opportunities to create impact.

Sachi is not a professional blogger, and this site is most likely not going to be promoted outside of his circle of friends. So if you found me, thank you for taking the time to read this page.

The opinions expressed in this site are mine and mine alone. They do not reflect the opinions of my employers (past or present), co-workers, family, pets, or possibly even me if the post youâ€™re reading is more than a few days old.
