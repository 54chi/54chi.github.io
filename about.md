Welcome to year 2 of this github blog. I may eventually port the contents of the previous year into this new style, but for now it is what it is. [Here is the year 1](http://54chi.com/specs/index.html).

54chi is addicted to coffee shops, and decent internet speed. He is not a professional blogger, and like in the previous year, this site is not going to be promoted. So if you found me, thank you for taking the time to read this page.

The opinions expressed in this site are mine and mine alone. They do not reflect the opinions of my employers (past or present), co-workers, family, pets, or possibly even me if the post youâ€™re reading is more than a few days old.
