Originally powered by [Ghost](http://ghost.org) and [Buster](https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster/), but after going through a few other static page generators, ultimately set up with [Jekyll](https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-jekyll-plus-a-free-bootstrap-3-starter-theme), so I can sort of edit content directly within Github if needed.

## Jekyll Quicksheet:

`jekyll -v` to check the version
`jekyll serve` will run a local web server to check your updates

Since creating posts (sp. the filename) is a bit annoying, I used [this post](http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/12/my-post-scaffolder-for-jekyll.html) to also include a script to scaffold a post.

`bash scaffold_post "A post title"` to create a post
