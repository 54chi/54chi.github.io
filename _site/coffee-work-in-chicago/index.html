            <p><em>Update (04/10/2016):</em> I guess I was not really done with my "rounds". Added a few more shops :)</p>

<p>Over the past weeks, I've been going around many of the awesome coffee shops that Chicago have, in part to get work done, and in part because I wanted to check them out.</p>

<p>You can find how awesome they are over yelp, but one thing that I wanted to test was their internet speeds (since I had to do some work).</p>

<p><del>Today, I'm officially done with my rounds</del>. Excluding Starbucks and Whole Foods, here are the results I got:</p>

<p><em>Tests were made at random times and days, so YMMV. I used <a href="http://speedtest.net">speedtest</a> and PureVPN (which also affects the test results)</em></p>

<p>Other places I went to (but can't find the stats for their wifi): Atomix, Osmium, Wormhole, Filter, Dollop (downtown), Bow Truss, Sip, Intelligentsia (Broadway), The Grind, Next Door, etc.</p>

<p>PS> In general, Starbucks have pretty good wifi in Chicago (thanks to Google), so it is a good alternative if you are not too much into fancy coffees. Whole Foods are better options for food and other drinks (wine, craft beers, pizza!), with plenty of plugs for your electronics, though their wifi could be slow.</p>
